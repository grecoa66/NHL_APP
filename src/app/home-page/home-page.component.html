                <p>
                    I started this project because I wanted to create a sample Anuglar 4 application.
                    I also love the NHL and thought it would be fun to create an application where I can learn more about the league.
                    I have no intentions to make this into a serious application, as there are dozens of nhl stat apps out there.

                <p>
                    This application was started with an Angular-CLI generated skeleton.
                    The front-end of this application was all written in Angular 4.
                    Twitter's Bootstrap 4 was used with NGX-Bootstrap for Styling and UI components.
                    A Node server using Express acts as an API while also hosting the app.

                    <a href="mysportsfeeds.com">MySportsFeeds </a> was used for all NHL Data.
                    I chose this site because their api is well documented and most importantly, it's free.
                    A user may notice that only past season records are available on this site.
                    This is because only past seasons data is available on the free-tier.
